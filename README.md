# C - Stacks, Queues / LIFO, FIFO

This is "monty", a minimal, stack-based programming language. With very few operations, the language is capable of virtually any output in the same manner as other minimal languages like Brainfuck (the "bf" folder contains some code in that language as an exercise).
